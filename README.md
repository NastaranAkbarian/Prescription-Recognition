# 💊 Prescription Recognition

Extract text from handwritten prescription images using Python and deep learning.
Designed for researchers, developers, and medical professionals to automate and improve prescription digitization with high accuracy.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Evaluate multiple OCR models (EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, TROCR, Tesseract) for handwritten Persian & English text.
- 🖼️ Image preprocessing to enhance OCR accuracy.
- 🧹 Text cleaning tailored to medical prescription language.
- 📊 Comprehensive evaluation metrics: precision, recall, edit distance, match rate.
- 📁 Batch processing of large datasets with ground truth labels.
- 📈 Phase-wise project development for systematic improvements.

## 🛠 Usage & Configuration

- **Input Images:** Put prescription images in `data/` folder or configure paths accordingly.
- **Labels:** Ground truth labels stored in `labels.xlsx`.
- **Modify OCR & Preprocessing:** Edit `utils.py` to customize OCR engines, preprocessing, or cleaning steps.
